# About

This repository contains the script used to convert the TCIA
[LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI)
XML representation of nodule annotations and characterizations into the DICOM
Segmentation object (for annotations) and DICOM Structured Reporting objects
(for nodule characterizations).

The results of conversion have been released in the [Standardized representation of the TCIA LIDC-IDRI annotations using DICOM](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/DOI/Standardized+representation+of+the+TCIA+LIDC-IDRI+annotations+using+DICOM) analysis results collections on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). 

The code in this repository served its purpose, and as such, is being archived. It is shared with the community to accompany the publication below in the spirit of transparency. 

You can learn about the details of conversion in this paper, which you are encouraged to cite if you use this code or the converted dataset in your work.
